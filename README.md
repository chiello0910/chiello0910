Creative Media Producer | Data-Driven Storytelling | Audience Analytics | Digital Content Strategy | 

### Hi there 👋 I'm Archiello Putra Irawan

I'm a Media Production student at Universitas Indonesia, passionate about blending creativity with data to tell compelling digital stories. I’m particularly interested in how insights into audience behavior can inform smarter content strategies and drive genuine engagement.

🔍 I love exploring how data and AI can support the creative process from building interactive dashboards with **Streamlit**, to using tools like **ChatGPT** and **Gemini** for content ideation and sentiment analysis.

🎬 With a background in media production and a strong interest in strategy, I enjoy working at the intersection of storytelling, technology, and user experience. I’ve also worked with strategic frameworks, such as **ABCD**, to optimize video performance and campaign effectiveness.

💡 I'm always looking to learn, collaborate, and contribute to innovative projects that combine content, design, and data to make an impact.

Let’s connect and create something meaningful!
